Several useful git commands for me:

1, cd [folder]
-- create a new folder for this repository and enter this folder, preparing for downloading

2, git clone [url of repository]
-- download the whole repository from cloud 

3, if you are using sublime, you can attach current file to the project(which is a repository)

4, git status (under the directory of project)
-- check the difference of local project and cloud project

5, git add [filename]/ -A (under the direcotry of project)
-- make the file committed/attached to the local project

6, git push
-- upload the whole local project to the cloud, updating the website side

7ï¼Œ git pull (under the same dirctory of project) 
-- for the other user who are working together with u. upload the repository from github to local project.

8, git
-- show u all of commands
